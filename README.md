## üß† Learning & Development

This project was inspired by the YouTube tutorial:  
**[Build and Deploy a Full Stack Real Time AI Voice Agent Interview Platform](https://youtu.be/8GK8R77Bd7g)** by **@JavaScript Mastery**.

I rebuilt the app from the ground up to deepen my understanding of:

- Next.js full-stack capabilities  
- Real-time AI and voice integration  
- Firebase authentication and database design  
- Advanced UI styling with Tailwind CSS and component libraries  
- Structuring scalable, reusable React components
